# YGEIA

![Dashboard](images/index.png)

## Dashboard
This project addresses critical mental health challenges in Catalonia's public health system by focusing on the social and health determinants that influence mental disorders. The integration of health and public data forms the cornerstone of this initiative, providing a comprehensive view of mental health across the region. This data supports the development of predictive models and analyses to identify trends, risk factors, and intervention opportunities.

The interactive dashboard is a vital tool in this endeavor, enabling the visualization of mental health prevalence and incidence across municipalities. Users can compare different cities and towns and interact with sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors that impact mental health. A dedicated section of the dashboard focuses on analyzing these factors to determine their influence on the incidence of mental health conditions.

By leveraging technological innovation, data analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration, this project aims to enhance the efficiency and comprehensiveness of mental health management in Catalonia. The ultimate goal is to improve the population's mental well-being and build a more resilient healthcare system through informed decision-making and targeted resource allocation.

**Note:** For security and data privacy reasons, specific files or directories containing sensitive information have been omitted from the repository. Consequently, the backend functionality will not be operational, and only the frontend will be visible. However, graphical elements may be absent. Please be aware that this limitation is intentional to safeguard data privacy.

## Our Collaborative Network

This project originates from the Engineering Projects course within the Bachelor's Degree in Data Science and Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia ([UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en/)). 

In collaboration with the Catalan Institute of Health ([ICS](https://ics.gencat.cat/ca/inici/)), we have established a robust network to tackle two critical challenges: mental health (YGEIA) and environmental health (EXAMBA). The environmental health initiative is passionately led by the dedicated and talented team [EXAMBA](https://github.com/examba-tech/dashboard). 

Together, we are devoted to fostering a healthier, more resilient community by applying data science to health.
